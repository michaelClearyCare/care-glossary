# Care Glossary
## Chrome Extension with Omnibox Functionality
## Usage
* Type the keyword, *def*, and hit *SPACE* or *ENTER* to activate the extension
* Now, type any terms, acronyms, abbreviations to see the definition appear as the top search result
* Selecting the result will open the Confluence page where the term is defined, or a more specific page if a link is included in the definition

## TODO (nice-to-haves)
* Implement "fuzzy" search
* Create central storage location for terms, accessible by everyone
* Allow users to add/remove terms
* Extrapolate functionality to include text highlighting, context menu, etc.
